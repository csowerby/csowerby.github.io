			I'm a fourth-year undergraduate at UCLA (Class of 2021). I study Physics and Mathematics, with an interest in computer science. My research focus is in plasma physics, where I work as an undergraduate researcher at UCLA's Basic Plasma Science Facility. I'm working under the director- Professor Troy Carter. I was born and grew up in Chicago where I went to high school at the University of Chicago Lab School.

			I'm currently (Spring 2021) working at the Basic Plasma Science Facility at UCLA modifying a linear eigenmode solver to incorporate a fully electromagnetic version of the set of Braginskii two-fluid equations. I am working on using this program to match eigenmodes and eigenvalues for experimentally observed drift-wave instabilities in cyclindrical geometry. I'm working on applying this program to plasmas in the beta regime (&beta; > 15&#37).

			Some of my past research involved developing a method for using using a raspberry pi/arduino camera module to be used for low latency rapid plasma imaging. I was working on imaging events that occured on a timescale of around ~100ns or less. I handed this project off before completion to start work on my current project. Before that I was working on developing a network socket controlled, Raspberry Pi circuit used to make an adjustable resistor to be used in Langmuir probes. You can check out these projects in more detail in the 'Projects' tab.

			Outside of academics, I enjoy playing chess online. Send <a href="https://lichess.org/@/csowerby" style="text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank"> me</a> a challenge on lichess if you want to play.
