				<p> For my research in Spring 2019, I worked on developing a solution to the problem of eliminating noise in measuring the electron and ion saturation current in Langmuir probes. 
					<br><br>
				When sweeping through voltages, it is difficult to measure both the ion and electron saturation currents with high accuracy. Since the ion and electron saturation currents are very different in magnitude, measuring the voltage drop across the same resistor is less precise due to a significant amount of noise from the ion current. If it would be possible to use different size resistors to measure the voltage drop, the data would be significantly easier to analyze. 
					<br> <br>
				My solution to this problem was a relay-controlled circuit to switch between several fixed valued resistors connected in parallel. Only one of the resistors was to be connected at once, so the saturation current would pass through the circuit over a resistor of chosen value by the user or the DAQ system. The power for the circuit as well as the signals to control the relays were sent from a Raspberry Pi via a DB9 connection to the outside of the circuit box.</p>
